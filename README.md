# invisibility_cloak
Invisibility cloak from Harry Potter using OpenCV
Ever wondered what it would be like to have the Invisibility Cloak from Harry Potter?
This project uses OpenCV to implement that ! 
Although there are several other codes for the same online, I found them to be unneccesarily complicated. 
The color used for this code is blue by default. It can be changed by changing the upper and lower values by using the respective HSv color ranges.
